A flutter app that incorporates firebase and firebase features such as RSVP authentication, firestone database etc. The code was having some issues running following the tutorial, it was because the Firebase.initializeApp() now has to be called before using any firebase product.

Next is the symchronized real time messaging feature, for this I ran the flutter code on 2 devices 1 by one and registered/logged in with different accounts on each to chat with one another.
